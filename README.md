## Description <a id="description"></a>

  This is a social media API that allows users to create a post, edit a post, delete a post, and comment on other posts. The user will be able to sign up or login into their account on the website. The user will be able to logout of their account as well. For this project, I used ```MongoDB```, ```Mongoose```, and ```Express.js```. I've also used a Javascript library called ```Moment.js``` to format the date and time. The seed data is created using ```Insomnia```.

  Once you installed everything, run ``` npm start ``` to start the application. Open MongoDb on ```Studio 3T``` and connect to the database. Click on socialmediaDB database to see thoughts and users data. To create seed data and run API routes, open ```Insomnia```.
