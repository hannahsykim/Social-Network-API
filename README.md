## Description <a id="description"></a>

This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. For this project, I used ```MongoDB```, ```Mongoose```, and ```Express.js```. I've also used a Javascript library called ```Moment.js``` to format the date and time. The seed data is created using ```Insomnia```.

  Clone the repository, run 
  ```Node.js ``` and ``` MongoDB ``` in your terminal, and then install the necessary dependencies by running ``` npm i ```.

## Usage <a id="usage"></a>

  Once you installed everything, run ``` npm start ``` to start the application. Open MongoDb on ```Studio 3T``` and connect to the database. Click on socialmediaDB database to see thoughts and users data. To create seed data and run API routes, open ```Insomnia```.
